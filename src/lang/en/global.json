The respective mobility services can only be used with EVAG's 24-hour breakdown service. This service also determines the type and scope of services with the aim of ensuring the renter’s mobility. If the renter engages other persons for the mobility service, EXPLORE VACATIONS AG assumes no responsibility, and the renter is fully liable for damages caused to the rental vehicle by such persons.",
    "l24.11": "Gross negligence The parties define grossly negligent behavior which, in accordance with clause 15.6 – even if liability limitation or insurance has been concluded – results in full and unlimited liability of the renter to the lessor or third parties, in particular, but not limited to:",

If the Hirer returns the vehicle early, i.e. before the end of the agreed rental period, this shall not result in early termination of the rental contract. In the event of early return or late collection of the vehicle, the Hirer shall not be entitled to a reduction of the agreed rental price.",
    "l25.2": "The Hirer is obliged to return the vehicle to an employee responsible for vehicle returns at the depot and at the time agreed upon, if such an employee is present. If the Hirer returns the vehicle to a depot different from the one agreed upon or at a later time than the agreed time of return, an additional charge of CHF 20.00 is due on account of the additional expense. This charge is in addition to any one-way charges or the costs of days of rental. The vehicle is deemed to have been returned to the Rental Company when it has been locked via the digital services of EXPLORE VACATIONS AG (‘virtual return’) or when the vehicle and key have been returned to and the vehicle has been checked by the Rental Company (“Registration”). In the event of a virtual return or if the vehicle is returned outside the opening hours of the depot, the Hirer remains responsible for it until it has been registered by the Rental Company. The same applies if, in the presence of an employee responsible, the Hirer leaves the depot before the vehicle has been registered.",
    "l25.3": "If the Hirer does not return the vehicle and the vehicle key to the Rental Firm at the end of the agreed rental period, even if this is not the Hirer’s fault, the Rental Firm shall be entitled to demand compensation for use for the period of retention at least in the amount of the previously agreed hire charge. In addition, the Hirer shall be obliged to pay a lump sum of CHF 50,00 (incl. VAT) as compensation for the associated processing costs, unless the Hirer proves that the Rental Firm has incurred less expense and/or damage. The assertion of further damages is not excluded.",
    "l25.4": "The Hirer shall return the vehicle as well as the extras in a condition corresponding to the contractual use. In the event of damage, excessive wear and tear, or soiling of the vehicle, the customer shall pay compensation for this. A concluded limitation of liability in accordance with Clause 15.5 provides no exemption from compensation for excessive wear and tear or soiling of the vehicle unless this relates to the interior when the corresponding protection package is purchased and results from the normal operation of the vehicle.",
    "l25.5": "For rentals longer than 27 days, the Hirer bears the costs of top-up fluids (especially engine oil, AdBlue, windscreen washing liquid and anti-icing liquid) up to 8% of the (net) monthly rental charge, if these fluids need to be topped up during the rental period.",
    "l25.6": "For vehicles fitted with an AdBlue®-Tank, the renter must make sure that the AdBlue®-Tank is always sufficiently filled.

    "l25.7": "Data may be stored in the vehicle if the navigation device is used or mobile or other devices are paired with the vehicle. If the Hirer/driver wishes that the aforementioned data can no longer be accessed in the vehicle after the return of the vehicle, he/she must ensure that such data is deleted before returning the vehicle. Deletion can be carried out by resetting the vehicle’s navigation and communication systems to the factory settings. Instructions for this can be found in the operating instructions located in the glove compartment. The Rental Firm has the right to delete the aforementioned data, however.",
    "l25.8": "The Hirer has an obligation to inform EXPLORE VACATIONS AG of damage to the vehicle during the hire period immediately after such damage has occurred. As a rule, the Rental Firm makes a record of the condition of the vehicle at the time of return as part of the registration process, which must be signed by both parties, thereby providing a binding record of the vehicle’s condition. In the event of a virtual return of the vehicle or if the Hirer returns the vehicle outside the opening hours of the rental depot or if, for other reasons, no record is made of the condition of the vehicle when it is returned, EXPLORE VACATIONS AG is entitled to unilaterally record any damage, excessive wear and tear or soiling and to report this to the Hirer within a period of 3 working days after registration. In the absence of such notification, the vehicle shall be deemed to have been returned in good order, with the express exception.",
    "l25.9": "After the expiry of the rental contract or after the agreed rental period has been exceeded, the Rental Firm shall be entitled to take possession of the vehicle at any time or to obtain it at the expense of the Hirer and to charge for any additional use of the rental contract.",
    "l25.10": "This also applies to longer-term rentals in the event that the Hirer is more than 15 days overdue with the agreed hire charges or it is foreseeable that he/she will no longer be able to meet the obligations of the rental contract. The rental contract shall end at the agreed time. With the agreement of the Rental Firm, the contract can be extended if the Hirer requests this at least three days before the expiry of the agreed rental period. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the same conditions shall apply to the extended rental period as to the originally agreed rental period or the conditions adjusted to the rental period. The extension may only be made in writing to the respective depot of the Rental Firm and only by the Hirer himself/herself.",
    "l25.11": "Special rates are only valid for the period offered and require that the rental is for the full rental period agreed at the time of rental. If the agreed rental period is exceeded or shortened, the applicable rate for the entire rental period is the normal rate and not the special rate. EXPLORE VACATIONS AG expressly reserves the right to claim further damages.",
    "l25.12": "In the case of long-term rentals (rentals with an agreed rental period of more than 25 days), the Hirer has an obligation to return the vehicle when the mileage stated in the rental agreement is reached, but no later than on the last rental day stated in the rental contract. In the event that the Hirer exceeds the mileage stated in the Rental Contract by more than 100 km and/or returns the vehicle after the date stated in the Rental Contract, the Hirer shall be liable to pay a contractual penalty of CHF 850; this shall not apply insofar as the Hirer proves that the Rental Firm has suffered no loss or a smaller loss. This contractual penalty applies in addition to the normal rate for any longer rental period. If the mileage stated in the rental contract is reached, the Hirer will receive a replacement vehicle of equal value for the remaining rental period upon return of the vehicle.",

    "h27": "Digital Renting",
    "l27": "In deviation from Clause 2.2, in the case of a digital rental (e.g. via the EXPLORE VACATIONS AG App, Mobile Check-In, etc.), the content of the concluded contract together with the displayed General Rental Terms and Conditions is confirmed by the Hirer by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the digital services of EXPLORE VACATIONS AG; the Hirer hereby declares that he/she has taken note of and understood the content of the contract and expressly agrees to it. The content of the concluded contract can be retrieved within the framework of the digital services of EXPLORE VACATIONS AG or is provided to the Hirer by email and therefore confirmed to both parties with binding effect.",

The loss of access data must be reported to EXPLORE VACATIONS AG immediately by email (info@explorevacations.ch). The access data is not transferable.",

    "l27.2": "In addition to Clause 12.2, the use of EXPLORE VACATIONS AG’s digital services for the rental of vehicles is prohibited if the Hirer’s driving licence is revoked or if other circumstances restricting the driving licence occur (e.g. restriction of the driving licence, temporary seizure or confiscation of the driving licence or a driving ban imposed by a court or the authorities).",

    "l27.3": "For specific services, EXPLORE VACATIONS AG requests the Hirer at regular intervals to verify that he/she holds a valid driving licence.
